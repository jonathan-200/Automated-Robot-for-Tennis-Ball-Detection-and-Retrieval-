# Automated-Robot-for-Tennis-Ball-Detection-and-Retrieval-
This collaborative project, completed with two fellow students from Arizona State University, involved the creation of a robot designed for ball retrieval in sports facilities.

We began by purchasing a basic robot kit online, we proceeded to assemble the robot, utilizing a Raspberry Pi for control. We designed a cardboard end effector mechanism, powered by servomotors, to enable the robot to grasp the tennis ball.

For object detection, we curated a dataset comprising 600 tennis ball images and trained a YOLO v8 nano model on it, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 98%. Additionally, we established a connection between the robot and a local device, where the processing would take place. Once processed, the commands would be transmitted back to the robot.

This project served as a comprehensive learning opportunity, fostering our expertise across various domains including robotics, problem-solving, programming, machine learning, computer vision, and computer networks. It was a rewarding experience that culminated in receiving an A+ grade for our coursework and project.

Here's a video of how this works:
